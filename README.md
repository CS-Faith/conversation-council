# 🗣️ Conversation Council — Multi-Perspective AI Discussion

> 历史 AI 会话中藏着大量未被利用的知识。Conversation Council 将这些历史会话转化为「AI 专家」小组，以第一人称视角参与新讨论 —— 让你的历史会话终于能「开口说话」。

> **Your past AI conversations contain answers you're not using.** Conversation Council turns your historical sessions into a panel of AI "experts" who advise you in first-person — so your history finally speaks back.

> Turn your Reasonix chat history into a panel of AI experts. Each past conversation becomes a "council member" that speaks in first-person, bringing its accumulated knowledge and stance to your current discussion.

## 🎯 The Problem

You have **139+ past AI conversations** spanning weeks of work — each one contains valuable context, decisions, and domain knowledge. But when you start a new conversation, that knowledge is **trapped in silos**. You can manually copy-paste context, but that's tedious and incomplete.

## 💡 The Solution

**Conversation Council** turns your chat history into an expert panel. When you ask a question, it:

1. **Scans** your Reasonix session history
2. **Extracts** structured summaries from each conversation (domain, entities, decisions, stance)
3. **Matches** which past conversations are relevant to your question
4. **Generates** first-person responses from each relevant "council member"
5. **Presents** them in a group-chat format with a coordinator

```
You: "Should we upgrade to Spring Boot 3.2?"

【Council Coordinator】
  I've convened 3 relevant council members...

**【Backend Migration Expert - 2026-06-24】**
  I've been through this. javax→jakarta is the biggest pain point.
  My system has 3 modules that need rewriting — plan for 5 person-days.
  Let the 3.0 systems upgrade first as validation.

**【LLM WIKI Pipeline - 2026-06-30】**
  The real problem isn't code — it's documentation. All internal wiki
  references with old package names will break. Run a batch scan first.

**【Zentao PM - 2026-06-24】**
  I can create tracking tickets in Zentao. Let me set up an iteration
  to track upgrade progress across all systems.

## 🏗️ Architecture

```
Reasonix Session Files (.jsonl)
        │
        ▼
  Session Scanner (139 sessions → ranked by recency)
        │
        ▼
  Summary Extractor (DeepSeek LLM → structured persona per session)
        │
        ▼
  Council Config (user selects which sessions become members)
        │
        ▼
  Match Engine (LLM: which members are relevant to the question?)
        │
        ▼
  Spokesperson Generator (LLM: each member responds in first-person)
        │
        ▼
  Group-Chat Format (multi-agent-discuss style presentation)
```

---

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- [Reasonix](https://github.com/CS-Faith/reasonix-portakit) (with session history)
- Python 3.10+ (included in Reasonix portable)
- DeepSeek API key (for LLM calls)

### Installation

```bash
# 1. Copy skill files to Reasonix skills directory
cp -r conversation-council/ ~/.reasonix/skills/conversation-council/

# 2. Or clone directly
git clone https://github.com/CS-Faith/reasonix-conversation-council.git \
  ~/.reasonix/skills/conversation-council/
```

### First Run

In any Reasonix conversation:

```
/skill conversation-council
```

The skill will scan your session history and ask which conversations to invite as council members. You can select by:
- **Number**: `1, 2, 4, 6`
- **Keyword**: "all about LLM WIKI"
- **Date range**: "last week's conversations"
- **Custom**: any combination

### Daily Use

After setup, anytime you want multi-perspective input:

```
/skill conversation-council
Should we migrate from MySQL to PostgreSQL?
```

## 📋 CLI Commands

```bash
python council.py scan --recent 20        # List recent sessions
python council.py init --sessions "id1,id2"  # Select council members
python council.py speak "your question"   # Run a council discussion
python council.py manage --list           # List current members
python council.py manage --add "id"       # Add a member
python council.py manage --remove "id"    # Remove a member
python council.py extract --force         # Refresh all summaries
```

---

## 💰 Cost

| Operation | Tokens | When |
|-----------|--------|------|
| Initial scan (139 sessions) | ~5,000 | One-time |
| Summary extraction per member | ~500/member | One-time (cached) |
| Each council discussion | ~3,000-5,000 | Per question |

With DeepSeek pricing (~¥0.001/1K tokens), each council discussion costs **less than ¥0.005** — essentially free.

## 🔌 Compatibility

**Supports Reasonix v0.53 / v1.X (Go rewrite) / Codex** with automatic format detection — no manual configuration needed.

### v0.53 Format
- Session files: `desktop-YYYYMMDDHHMM-N.jsonl`
- Metadata: `.meta.json` (contains `summary`, `totalCostUsd`)

### v1.X Format (Go Rewrite)
- Session files: `*.jsonl` or `*.events.jsonl`
- Metadata: `.meta` (BranchMeta JSON with `Preview`, `Turns`, `Scope`)
- Honors `REASONIX_HOME` / `%APPDATA%`

### Codex Format
- Data directory: `~/.codex/` (PortaKit-aware auto-detection)
- Session index: `session_index.jsonl` (UUID → `thread_name`)
- Session files: `sessions/YYYY/MM/DD/rollout-*.jsonl` + `archived_sessions/*.jsonl`
- 22 envelope `type` values auto-mapped to standard `{role, content}`

### Shared JSONL Message Format

```jsonl
{"role":"user","content":"..."}
{"role":"assistant","content":"...","tool_calls":[...]}
{"role":"tool","tool_call_id":"...","content":"..."}
```

### Extending to Other AI Agents

The core architecture is **platform-agnostic**. To support another platform, write a `read_*_messages()` adapter → the rest is unchanged.

| Platform | Effort | What You Need |
|----------|:--:|------|
| Reasonix v0.53 | ✅ Built-in | Auto-detected |
| Reasonix v1.X (Go) | ✅ Built-in | Auto-detected |
| Codex | ✅ Built-in | Index + rollout JSONL auto-scan |
| ChatGPT exports | Low | Parse `conversations.json` to extract `role` + `content` |
| Claude exports | Low | Parse Claude's JSON export format |
| LibreChat | Medium | Read conversation documents from MongoDB |
| Custom agent logs | Low | Any JSONL or JSON file with `role` + `content` fields |
| Loop Agent threads | Medium | Read `threads/*.json` from the mesh engine |

**The key insight**: once a conversation is reduced to a 500-character structured summary, its origin platform doesn't matter. The council only reads summaries, never raw logs.

---

## 🧩 Integration

- **Loop Agent (Conversation Mesh)**: Conversation Council can serve as the "master thread UI" — each council member corresponds to a mesh sub-thread
- **multi-agent-discuss**: Council output follows the same `**【Role】**` + coordinator format
- **engine.py**: Reuses `extract_summary()` prompts for structured persona extraction
